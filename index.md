### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    This lab was my favorite because of its experimental nature. 
    It allowed me to use the  knowledge I got from basic programming 
    such as variables, arithmetic operations, and functions, in a practical 
    environment. I liked coding, checking it against black box methods, 
    and watching it operate as intended. Actually, the bug-free process 
    of debugging my code and making sure it was as such really gave 
    me confidence in my code writing skills. 



* Lab 7

    This lab was my favorite one because it mostly enlightened to me a 
    technique of securing user inputs by writing defensive code and 
    verifying submitted commands. Using compound Boolean expressions in 
    if statements was the very thing that enabled me to create complex 
    logic which made the program more dependable. It remains the most 
    significant tool to develop error-free, robust code, which is a major 
    attribute of software development.


* Lab 12

    This was my favorite lab due to its fun and creative potential which 
    allowed me to make animations and use random numbers. The fact that I 
    can now use the library functions along with the code increased 
    its functionality. As a result, I could see the dynamic results 
    without exception making the entire process interesting and satisfying. 
    It was a great manifestation of my creativity and technical skills.
